Creating planar or “locking” structures is of particular interest for tuning electronic properties. While noncovalent locks are an effective strategy for increasing planarity, the precise interactions leading to these planar structures are often unknown or mischaracterized. In this study, we demonstrate that aromaticity can be used to investigate, interpret, and modify the complex physical interactions which lead to planarity. Furthermore, we clearly illustrate the important role aromaticity has in determining the structure through torsional preferences and find that modern noncovalent locks utilize hyperconjugation to alter aromaticity and increase planarity. We envision that our approach and our explanation of prevalent noncovalent locks will assist in the design of improved materials for organic electronics.","tags":[],"title":"Aromaticity as a Guide to Planarity in Conjugated Molecules and Polymers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Changfei He","Peter R.

While increasing MW of linear segments yields a lower storage modulus at the rubbery plateau after softening above the glass transition (Tg), both Tg and the characteristic time of stress relaxation are independently governed by the conformational entropy of the embodied linear segments. Activation energies for bond exchange in the solid state are lower for networks incorporating flexible chains; the network topology freezing temperature decreases with increasing MW of flexible linear segments but increases with increasing MW of stiff segments. Vitrimer reconfigurability is therefore influenced not only by the energetics of bond exchange for a given network density, but also the entropy of polymer chains within the network.","tags":[],"title":"Conformational Entropy as a Means to Control the Behavior of Poly (diketoenamine) Vitrimers In and Out of Equilibrium","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kara D.

However, the atomistic phenomena governing ion diffusion and migration in polyelectrolytes are poorly understood, particularly in nonaqueous solvents. Here, the structural and transport properties of a model polyelectrolyte solution, poly(allyl glycidyl ether-lithium sulfonate) in dimethyl sulfoxide, are studied using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the static structural analysis of Li+ ion pairing is insufficient to fully explain the overall conductivity trend, necessitating a dynamic analysis of the diffusion mechanism, in which we observe a shift from largely vehicular transport to more structural diffusion as the Li+ concentration increases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that despite the significantly higher diffusion coefficient of the lithium ion, the negatively charged polyion is responsible for the majority of the solution conductivity at all concentrations, corresponding to Li+ transference numbers much lower than previously estimated experimentally. We quantify the ion–ion correlations unique to polyelectrolyte systems that are responsible for this surprising behavior. These results highlight the need to reconsider the approximations typically made for transport in polyelectrolyte solutions.","tags":[],"title":"Ion Transport and the True Transference Number in Nonaqueous Polyelectrolyte Solutions for Lithium-Ion Batteries","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"With the rise of modern high performance computers, it is possible to run quantum and classical simulations in automated high-throughput fashion.

In particular, exhaustive knowledge of solvation struc- ture, stability, and transport properties is critical for developing stable electrolytes for fast-charging and high-energy-density next-generation energy storage systems. Accordingly, there is growing interest in the rational design of electrolytes for beyond lithium-ion systems by tuning the molecular-level interactions of solvate species present in the electrolytes. Here we present a review of the solvation struc- ture of multivalent electrolytes and its impact on the electrochemical performance of these batteries. A direct correlation between solvate species present in the solu- tion and macroscopic properties of electrolytes is sparse for multivalent electrolytes and contradictory results have been reported in the literature. This review aims to illustrate the current understanding, compare results, and highlight future needs and directions to enable the deep understanding needed for the rational design of improved multivalent electrolytes.","tags":[],"title":"Elucidating Solvation Structures for Rational Design of Multivalent Electrolytes — A Review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julian Self","Brandon M.

As case studies, we consider the low dielectric constant solvent dimethyl carbonate with LiAsF6 and LiPF6 salts at low concentrations. Using both quantum “ab initio” methods as well classical molecular dynamics simulations, we elucidate the salt’s contribution to the dielectric constant as well as the dipolar relaxation times, which act as quantitative signatures. By comparing to previously published measurements, we provide strong evidence for the presence of contact-ion pairs at these low concentrations. Interestingly, these ion pairs increase the dielectric constant of the solution, allowing for significantly improved ionic conductivity as a function of salt concentrations. We also discuss the role of multimeric equilibrium species as contributors to the functional properties of designer electrolytes, such as dielectric properties of the solution and ionic conductivity.","tags":[],"title":"The Interplay between Salt Association and the Dielectric Properties of Low Permittivity Electrolytes: The Case of LiPF6 and LiAsF6 in Dimethyl Carbonate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kiran Mathew","Joseph H.

Atomate also enables the computational characterization of materials by providing workflows that calculate X-ray absorption (XAS), Electron energy loss (EELS) and Raman spectra. One of the major features of atomate is that it provides both fully functional workflows as well as reusable components that enable one to com- pose complex materials science workflows that use a diverse set of computational tools.
