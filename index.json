Ultimately, our ability to select quality hyperparameters governs the performance for a given model. In the past, and even some currently, hyperparameters were hand selected through trial and error. An entire field has been dedicated to improving this selection process; it is referred to as hyperparameter optimization (HPO). Inherently, HPO requires testing many different hyperparameter configurations and as a result can benefit tremendously from massively parallel resources like the Perlmutter system we are building at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC). As we prepare for Perlmutter, we wanted to explore the multitude of HPO frameworks and strategies that exist on a model of interest. This article is a product of that exploration and is intended to provide an introduction to HPO methods and guidance on running HPO at scale based on my recent experiences and results.\nDisclaimer; this article contains plenty of general non-software specific information about HPO, but there is a bias for free open source software that is applicable to our systems at NERSC.\nScalable HPO with Ray Tune Being able to leverage the power of modern compute resources to run HPO at scale is important to efficiently search hyperparameter space — especially in the time of deep learning (DL) where the size of neural networks continues to increase. Luckily for all of us, the folks at Ray Tune have made scalable HPO easy. Below is a graphic of the general procedure to run Ray Tune at NERSC. Ray Tune is an open-source python library for distributed HPO built on Ray. Some highlights of Ray Tune: - Supports any ML framework - Internally handles job scheduling based on the resources available - Integrates with external optimization packages (e.g. Ax, Dragonfly, HyperOpt, SigOpt) - Implements state-of-the-art schedulers (e.g. ASHA, AHB, PBT)\nI have enjoyed using Ray Tune, but if you choose a different HPO framework, no worries, there is still plenty of general information in this article.\nHow to Select an HPO strategy Schedulers vs Search Algorithms One of the first distinctions I want to point out about HPO strategies, is the difference between a scheduler and a search algorithm. The search algorithm governs how hyperparameter space is sampled and optimized (e.g. random search). From a practical standpoint, the search algorithm provides a mechanism to select hyperparameter configurations (i.e. trials) to test. A search algorithm is always necessary for HPO. Alternatively, schedulers improve the overall efficiency of the HPO by terminating unpromising trials early. For example, if I use random search, some of the trials are expected to perform poorly, so it would be nice to have the ability to terminate those trials early — saving valuable compute resources. This is what a scheduler does. A scheduler is not necessary for HPO but they massively improve performance. Below are brief descriptions and references for the schedulers and the search algorithms I tested.\nAsync Successive Halving Algorithm (ASHA — scheduler) First, I want to define the successive halving algorithm (SHA), and instead of doing it myself, I really like the definition given in this paper — they also have pseudocode of the SHA and ASHA, if you are interested.\n The idea behind SHA is simple: allocate a small budget to each configuration, evaluate all configurations and keep the top 1/η, increase the budget per configuration by a factor of η, and repeat until the maximum per-configuration budget of R is reached.\n This graphic was adapted from an AutoML post.\nThe SHA does not parallelize well because all configurations need to be evaluated for a short time before the top 1/η can be selected. This creates a bottleneck at each rung (each successive halving is referred to as a rung). ASHA decouples trial promotion and rung completion, such that trials can be advanced to the next rung at any given time. If a trial cannot be promoted additional trials can be added to the base rung so more promotions are possible.\nA major assumption of SHA and ASHA is that if a trial performs well over an initial short time interval it will perform well at longer time intervals. A classic example where this assumption can break down is tuning learning rates. Larger learning rates may outperform smaller learning rates at short times causing the smaller learning rate trials to be erroneously terminated. In practice, I am honestly not sure how much this matters.\nAsync Hyperband (AHB — scheduler) Hyperband (HB) is a scheduler designed to mitigate the SHA\u0026rsquo;s bias towards initial performance. HB essentially loops over the SHA with a variety of halving rates — attempting to balance early termination with providing more resources per trial regardless of initial performance. Each loop of the SHA is considered a bracket, which can have a number of rungs. See the figure below. AHB is identical to HB except it loops over ASHA. The AHB and ASHA implementation used in Ray Tune is described in this paper.\nPopulation Based Training (PBT — hybrid) I call PBT a hybrid because it has aspects of both a scheduler and a search algorithm. It can also function as an HPO strategy and a trainer all-in-one. More on that in the Not all Hyperparameters Are the Same section. At a high-level, PBT is similar to a genetic algorithm. There is a population of workers, where each worker is assigned a random configuration of hyperparameters (trial) and at set intervals hyperparameter configurations are replaced by higher performing workers in the population (exploitation) and randomly perturbed (exploration). The user can set the balance of exploitation vs exploration. Here are a couple resources to learn more, blog and paper.\nRandom Search (RS — search algorithm) When the hyperparameter space of interest is reasonably large, too large for a grid search, the default algorithm is random search. This is exactly as it sounds, hyperparameter configurations or trials are randomly selected from the search space. If given enough compute time RS works reasonably well.\nBayesian Optimization (BO — search algorithm) BO provides an algorithmic approach to determining the optimal hyperparameters, instead of randomly searching. Because the objective function is unknown in HPO a black-box optimizer like BO is necessary. In BO a surrogate models the objective function and an acquisition function is used for sampling new points or new hyperparameter configurations in this case. Gaussian processes are typically used as the surrogate models in BO for HPO. Ideally, BO can converge towards the optimal hyperparameters much more efficiently than random search.\nTime-to-Solution Study To compare different HPO strategies I decided to keep it simple and focus on the average time-to-solution, which is a metric that is relatively straightforward to interpret. There are a couple caveats for my results:\n I did this work with a particular model and problem in mind (more on that below), so I do not expect these results to be completely general. There are many arbitrary choices that go into various HPO strategies that may alter the results.\n  Model details The model I was interested in optimizing hyperparameters for is a graph neural network used in the field of catalysis to predict adsorption energies. Specific details can be found here.\nHyperparameters There were six hyperparameters I examined and they are listed below:\n Learning Rate Batch Size Atom Embedding Size Number of Graph Convolution Layers Fully Connected Feature Size Number of Fully Connected Layers  Pro Tip: When making decisions about the size of the hyperparameter space you want to search — consider memory usage. When tuning network architecture and batch size I ran into memory issues on our 16GB GPUs at NERSC.\nQuestions Explored  What is the impact of a scheduler? How much can a sophisticated search algorithm improve HPO?  The first question I wanted to investigate was the impact of using a scheduler. To address this question I compared the time-to-solution of ASHA/RS, AHB/RS, and RS using the same computational resources for each (4 Cori GPU Nodes for 8 hours). All three strategies use the same search algorithm with the addition of the ASHA and the AHB schedulers. The notation I am using is scheduler/search algorithm.\nGoing beyond a scheduler, I was curious how much a \u0026ldquo;smarter\u0026rdquo; search algorithm, such as BO, would improve HPO performance. To explore this question I compared the time-to-solution of ASHA/RS and ASHA/BO using the same computational resources for each (4 Cori GPU Nodes for 4 hours).\nResults and Discussion Average time-to-solution plot comparing ASHA/RS, AHB/RS, and RS given the same computational resources ASHA/RS clearly outperformed both AHB/RS and RS by reaching a lower average test MAE in a shorter period of time. ASHA/RS improved the time-to-solution by at least 5x compared to RS. I say at least 5x, because RS did not converge to the lower limit of the test MAE in the 8 hour limit. Additionally, more ASHA/RS trials were close to the mean resulting in a smaller standard deviation. The top 6 trials were time averaged in all cases. I suspect the performance of ASHA/RS is largely because of the number of trials completed. ASHA/RS finished nearly 2x the trials of AHB/RS and over 8x the trials of RS. The number of trials finished can be seen in the top right corner. I should also mention that the number of ASHA/RS and AHB/RS trials are not at their upper limit because of the amount of checkpoint I was doing. Minimal checkpointing is critical for the performance of SHA based HPO strategies. This is illustrated by the number of trials finished in the ASHA/RS experiment below that used less checkpointing — the same amount of trials in half the time. The reduced checkpointing increased the time-to-solution improvement for ASHA/RS to approximately 10x compared to RS!\nAverage time-to-solution plot comparing ASHA/RS and ASHA/BO given the same computational resources It can be seen from the figure above that there is on average no benefit to adding BO for my particular model. My hypothesis is that the hyperparameter surface I was trying to optimize had a bunch of local minima (think egg carton) and no obvious global minimum, which would reduce the benefit of BO. Situations where I can see BO working well are large hyperparameter search spaces with a more well defined global minimum — not that you can know this a priori. Overall, I think a good approach to HPO is building complexity as needed. One last note on BO, while there was not an average improvement using BO the single best trial I found was using ASHA/BO. As a result, if I had to choose one configuration of hyperparameters that is what I would select.\nThe time delay between the ASHA/RS and the ASHA/BO curves is likely because the acquisition function used in BO needs to be conditioned with a certain amount of data before sampling new hyperparameter configurations.\nNot all Hyperparameters Can Be Treated the Same There are two main types of hyperparameters in ML and they dictate what HPO strategies are possible.\nModel Hyperparameters: Establish model architecture\n Number of convolutional layers Number of fully connected layers etc.  Algorithm Hyperparameters: Are involved in the learning process\n Learning rates Batch size Momentum etc.  The important takeaway is that not all HPO strategies can handle both model and algorithm hyperparameters. PBT is a good example. PBT was designed to evolve and inherit hyperparameters from other high performing workers in the population; however, if workers have different network architectures it is unclear to me how exactly that would work. There might be a way to do this with PBT, but it is not standard and does not work out-of-the-box with Ray Tune.\nOptimal Scheduling with PBT One of the nice features of PBT is the ability to develop an ideal scheduling procedure. For instance, I can determine the ideal learning rate throughout training, which is usually quite important. In my case, I want a configuration of hyperparameters and a learning rate scheduler that I can use to train my model repeatedly. Most ML frameworks include learning rate schedulers (e.g. multistep, reduce on plateau, exponential decay, etc.) to reduce the learning rate as training progresses. Hence, a custom learning rate scheduler can be developed using PBT and incorporated into a given ML framework for subsequent training.\nAlternatively, if repeated training is not necessary for your application PBT can be used directly as a training procedure and ideal schedules can be developed for all algorithm hyperparameters simultaneously.\nTraining with PBT is very efficient in terms of actual time, in fact it uses roughly the same amount of time as your normal training procedure, but total computational time goes up because multiple workers are necessary — maybe 16 - 32 GPUs. In Ray Tune, workers can also be time-multiplexed if the number of workers exceeds the resource size.\nOptimal Learning Rate — Results and Discussion I wanted to experiment with PBT and find a learning rate schedule for my model (described above). Here are the results.\nThe top plot shows the Test MAE for the best trial in the population. There are some jumps in the Test MAE where presumably random perturbations were attempted and since there was not an improvement the perturbations were ultimately reversed. The lower plot displays the learning rate as a function of training iterations. It appears that my ideal learning rate could reasonably be modeled by a multistep scheduler.\nCheat Sheet for Selecting an HPO Strategy Choosing an HPO strategy really depends on your particular application. For many of the chemistry and materials science applications that I am interested in, reasonably good hyperparameters that get us 85% of the way there will do just fine. Alternatively, some of you might be interested in squeezing out every last drop of performance for a given model. There is not a one-size-fits-all solution, but I\u0026rsquo;ve put together a little cheat sheet to help get the ideas flowing.\nTechnical Tips Ray Tune Ray Tune is very user friendly and you only need to consider a few things when setting it up to run your model (I am not going to go in-depth here because Ray Tune\u0026rsquo;s documentation and examples are great): 1. Define a trainable API, either function or class based — I recommend the class option as it allows you do much more 2. Write a script to run Tune via tune.run()\nGeneral Tips  Check to ensure your model is being put on the right device, this sounds silly but it\u0026rsquo;s worthwhile. Put a print statement in your _setup function, if you are using the class API, to double check\n Ray Tune has a bunch of handy functions (e.g. tune.uniform) to generate random distributions  Tune.run() Flags for Performance  checkpoint_at_end=False Default is False and I would leave it that way regardless of other checkpointing settings. True, should never be used with SHA based strategies sync_on_checkpoint=False This can improve performance but maybe only marginally — it depends on how frequently you are checkpointing fail_fast=True I like this flag because it kills a trial immediately after it fails, otherwise the trial can go through all training iterations where it fails each iteration reuse_actors=True This flag can improve performance on both ASHA and PBT but it requires you to add a reset_config function to your trainable class. In part, this flag can save time by not reloading your dataset everytime an old trial is terminated and a new trial begins.  Dragonfly — BO I like Dragonfly for Bayesian Optimization because of its ability to work with both discrete and continuous variables. Many BO packages only work with continuous variables and you have to hack your way around that issue. Nevertheless, I did find it a bit tricky to actually define the hyperparameter space. Below is the code snippet I used to set up Dragonfly BO for use with Ray Tune.\nparam_list = [{\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;atom_embedding_size\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;int\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;min\u0026quot;: 1, \u0026quot;max\u0026quot;: 100}, {\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;num_graph_conv_layers\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;int\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;min\u0026quot;: 1, \u0026quot;max\u0026quot;: 40}, {\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;fc_feat_size\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;int\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;min\u0026quot;: 1, \u0026quot;max\u0026quot;: 150}, {\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;num_fc_layers\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;int\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;min\u0026quot;: 1, \u0026quot;max\u0026quot;: 40}, {\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;lr\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;float\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;min\u0026quot;: 0.001, \u0026quot;max\u0026quot;: 0.1}, {\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;batch_size\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;discrete_numeric\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;items\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;40-61-79-102-120-141-163-183-201-210-225-238\u0026quot;}] param_dict = {\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;BO_CGCNN\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;domain\u0026quot;: param_list} domain_config = load_config(param_dict) domain, domain_orderings = domain_config.domain, domain_config.domain_orderings # define the hpo search algorithm BO func_caller = CPFunctionCaller(None, domain, domain_orderings=domain_orderings) optimizer = CPGPBandit(func_caller, ask_tell_mode=True) bo_search_alg = DragonflySearch(optimizer, metric=\u0026quot;validation_mae\u0026quot;, mode=\u0026quot;min\u0026quot;)  Slurm — Job Management For those using Slurm, as we do at NERSC, here are the scripts that enable the use of Ray Tune. The start-head.sh and start-worker.sh files can be copied directly; only the submit script requires minor modifications to execute your code on the resource and in the environment of choice. If you run into an issue where worker nodes are not starting and you see an error like this ValueError: The argument None must be a bytes object extend the sleep time after starting the head node found on this line. This is not a bug — the head node needs to set a variable and sometimes it takes a while.\nTensorBoard — Logging/Visualization Ray Tune logs with TensorBoard (TB) by default. A couple thoughts about HPO with TB and Ray Tune: * TB allows you to easily filter your results, which is important when you run 1000s of trials using ASHA * Good visualizations with the HParams Dashboard * TB works great with SHA based strategies in Ray Tune, my only complaint is the integration with PBT is not as good\nFor NERSC users here is how I usually run TB. One downside is that you can only have one TB client open at a time.\nWeights and Biases — Logging/Visualization W\u0026amp;B has a logger that integrates with Ray Tune and I used it with the model I was testing. Clearly a lot of potential exists and in general I like the W\u0026amp;B platform, but at the time (March/April 2020) I had difficulties logging large-scale HPO campaigns with W\u0026amp;B. I believe some updates/upgrades are in progress.\nKey Findings  The ASHA scheduler improved the time-to-solution for my model by at least 10x compared to random search alone BO may not always improve average HPO performance, but I was able to find my single best configuration of hyperparameters with ASHA/BO Using PBT, I found my optimal learning rate and it can be reasonably modeled with a multistep scheduler  Key Takeaways  Ray Tune is a simple and scalable HPO framework Using a scheduler to improve HPO efficiency is essential More sophisticated search algorithms such as BO likely provide some benefit but are not always worth the investment\n PBT is great for developing ideal schedulers and for training if the model does not need to be retained frequently There is no one-size-fits-all solution to HPO.

Wood"],"categories":[],"content":" Active Learning on Molecular Systems with GraphDot, xTB, ASE, and scikit-learn Original Post: 3/11/2020\nUpdated: 4/10/2020\nIntroduction Since the end of my PhD (Aug 2019), I have been interested in combining active learning with quantum calculations to explore configuration space in molecular systems. The goal of this post is to explore active learning on a simple system and to put a few ideas out there for people to think about and expand on. The other reason I wanted to make this post is that I think it is really cool how easily GraphDot/xTB/ASE/scikit-learn can be used together, so I thought I would share by example.\nI want to thank Yu-Hang Tang for all the help with the graph kernel, none of this would have been possible otherwise. If you want to learn more about the graph kernel, check out this publication.\nIf you have any questions or comments shoot me an email bwood@lbl.gov.\nDependencies All dependencies can be pip installed with the exception of xTB, which can now be install with conda, although I used a version I compiled. Additionally, the methods I used from GraphDot require a GPU.\n GraphDot xTB ASE scikit-learn Numpy Matplotlib tqdm  Conformations of Polyethylene Description of the system The toy problem I chose to explore is approximating the energy functional of an ensemble of polyethylene chain conformations. I defined the problem as follows. All chains are made up of 3 monomers — 6 carbon atoms. The rationale for short chains is to keep the degrees of freedom manageable for example purposes. Each chain consists of three C-C-C-C torsion angles ($\\phi$$_i$, $\\phi$$_j$, $\\phi$$_k$) and a conformation is defined as a unique set of the three torsion angles {$\\phi$$_i$, $\\phi$$_j$, $\\phi$$_k$}. I discretized the torsion angle distribution to contain 36 states equally spaced by 10 degrees. The ensemble of conformations is generated by sampling over all of the discrete torsional configurations, so there are ~ $36^3$ conformations — some of these are not unique because of symmetry.\nDescription of the active learning algorithm The objective is to find a surrogate model for calculating the energy of a chain conformation. Generally speaking, an energy evaluation with density functional theory (DFT) or another level of quantum chemistry is computationally expensive, so if we can generate a reasonable energy prediction (or predict another property of interest) with a machine learning model it saves computational time and expands the systems we can study. In this example, I generate a graph representation of the different conformations using GraphDot and then use a graph kernel with scikit-learn’s Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to predict energies. I could easily calculate all the conformer energies with xTB; however, if I wanted to use DFT or look at larger systems that would not be possible. As a result, I wanted to implement an active learning strategy. The active learning algorithm I employ is an iterative process where ~1000 conformations are predicted each step, and the 300 conformers with the largest prediction uncertainties are fed back into the training data for the next step. This procedure is intended to ensure that the model sees data that will maximally improve the model each step.\nImports import numpy as np import os import time from tqdm import tqdm  import xtb from xtb import GFN2 import ase from ase.io import read, write from ase.units import Hartree from ase.optimize import BFGSLineSearch  from graphdot import Graph from graphdot.graph.adjacency import AtomicAdjacency from graphdot.kernel.molecular import Tang2019MolecularKernel from graphdot.kernel.basekernel import KroneckerDelta, SquareExponential, TensorProduct from graphdot.kernel.marginalized import MarginalizedGraphKernel  %matplotlib inline import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  from sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import r2_score from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error  Generate dataset via torsional configurations Torsion angles range from 0 to 360 degrees or depending on the convention from -180 to 180 degrees.

For reference, chemical accuracy — the requirement to make useful chemical predictions — is generally considered to be 1 kcal/mol or ~ 0.04 eV. The final MAE value of 0.006 eV is well within that range, which is great, but there are a few caveats. For one, I used an energy cutoff of 1 eV so that limited the overall energy distribution. It would be interesting to compare my results to randomly guessing energy values within the 1 eV window. Additionally, torsional energy barriers can be low (\u0026lt; 0.025 eV), as a result we would hope that we could resolve those features in the potential energy surface.\nComment on the coefficient of determination ($R^2$): The interpretation of $R^2$ in this context is not entirely clear to me, but it says something about the amount of variance accounted for by the GPR model. It also tells us that our model is better than a model that always predicts the mean value of y regardless of the input features ($R^2$ = 0). TL;DR $R^2$ values increase with each active learning step indicating the model is improving.\nPredicting torsion potentials # torsion potentials are displayed using relative energies rel_sp_energies = np.array(tor_pot_sp_energies) - min(tor_pot_sp_energies)  rel_tor_predict = [array[0] - min(array[0]) for array in pe_gpr.pred_pot]  # propagate the error (energy – min(energy)) tor_std_prop = [] for array in pe_gpr.pred_pot: min_index = np.argmin(array[0]) err_prop = np.sqrt(np.power(array[1], 2) + np.power(array[1][min_index], 2)) tor_std_prop.append(err_prop)  def tor_pot_plot(rel_energy, rel_predict, std, color, ylim=(-0.2, 0.45)): fig = plt.figure() ax = plt.subplot(111) ax.plot(tor_pot_angles, rel_energy) ax.plot(tor_pot_angles, rel_predict, \u0026quot;o\u0026quot;, c=color) #ax.errorbar(tor_pot_angles, rel_predict, yerr=std, fmt=\u0026quot;o\u0026quot;, c=color) ax.fill_between(tor_pot_angles, rel_predict - std, rel_predict + std, alpha=0.125) ax.set_xlabel(r\u0026quot;Torsion Angle ($\\degree$)\u0026quot;, fontsize=15) ax.set_ylabel(\u0026quot;Relative\\nEnergy (eV)\u0026quot;, rotation=0, labelpad=50, fontsize=15) ax.set_ylim(ylim) ax.set_yticks([0.00, 0.15, 0.35]) ax.set_xticks([0, 180, 360]) ax.spines[\u0026quot;right\u0026quot;].set_visible(False) ax.spines[\u0026quot;top\u0026quot;].set_visible(False) ax.legend([\u0026quot;True\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Predict\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Predict Uncertainty\u0026quot;], loc=\u0026quot;upper right\u0026quot;, bbox_to_anchor=(1.4 ,1), frameon=False) return fig.show()  Torsion potential after initial training tor_pot_plot(rel_sp_energies, rel_tor_predict[0], tor_std_prop[0], \u0026quot;C6\u0026quot;)  Torsion potential after step 5 tor_pot_plot(rel_sp_energies, rel_tor_predict[5], tor_std_prop[5], \u0026quot;C4\u0026quot;)  Torsion potential after step 10 tor_pot_plot(rel_sp_energies, rel_tor_predict[10], tor_std_prop[10], \u0026quot;C1\u0026quot;)  Comment on the torsion potential data: It is possible that the model saw some of these points during training.\nPredicting relaxed torsion potentials All the previous data points are single point energies, meaning that I took the initial relaxed structured, rotated the torsion angles, and calculated the energies without doing another relaxation step. Generally, when calculating a torsion potential, I would constrain the torsion angle of interest and do another relaxation. It turns out this is currently not possible with the xTB/ASE combination, but it is very simple to in xTB without the ASE interface. As a result, I read in the files from xTB. The relaxed molecules are guaranteed\n# read in the relaxed molecules relax_tor_mols = read(\u0026quot;./xtbscan.log\u0026quot;, index=\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;, format=\u0026quot;xyz\u0026quot;)  relax_tor_graphs = [Graph.from_ase(mol, adjacency=adj) for mol in relax_tor_mols]  # read in the energies relax_tor_ev_energies = [] with open(\u0026quot;./xtbscan.log\u0026quot;) as file: for i, line in enumerate(file): if \u0026quot;SCF done\u0026quot; in line: # energies are in Hatrees tor_ha_energy = float(line.split()[2]) relax_tor_ev_energies.append(tor_ha_energy * 27.211386245988)  # relative energies rel_relax_tor_energies = np.array(relax_tor_ev_energies) - min(relax_tor_ev_energies)  relax_tor_predict, relax_tor_std = pe_gpr.gpr.predict(relax_tor_graphs, return_std=True)   0.5 ms on generating jobs 0.4 ms on creating output buffer 0.8 ms on transferring graphs to GPU 0.1 ms on allocate global job counter 8.9 ms on code generation 193.2 ms on JIT 0.4 ms on calculating launch configuration 2.0 ms on GPU kernel execution 205.6 ms on calling GPU kernel (overall) 0.0 ms on collecting result  # relative predicted energies rel_relax_tor_predict = np.array(relax_tor_predict) - min(relax_tor_predict)  # propagate the error (energy – min(energy)) min_i = np.argmin(rel_relax_tor_energies) relax_tor_std_prop = np.sqrt(np.power(relax_tor_std, 2) + np.power(relax_tor_std[min_i], 2))  tor_pot_plot(rel_relax_tor_energies, rel_relax_tor_predict, relax_tor_std_prop, \u0026quot;C2\u0026quot;, ylim=(-0.1, 0.35))  Predicting the energy of relaxed structures is not fantastic but the shape of the potential is roughly correct, and the good news is that the model knows what it doesn’t know. The prediction uncertainty for these is high compared to the previous torsion potential predictions. Relaxations cause fluctuations in other degrees of freedom such as bond lengths and bond angles, which the model was not trained on. So, if predicting the energy of relaxed structures is the goal some examples should be included in the training set.\nConclusions  The graphs and molecular graph kernel from GraphDot have enough resolution to tell the difference between torsional conformers of the same molecule Good energy predictions ($\u0026lt;k_BT$) can be achieved on small datasets with the implemented graph kernel and GPR model Prediction uncertainties are very useful and a huge advantage of a GPR model. Chemistry or materials science problems where generating semi-realistic structures is easy but energy evaluations are expensive are most likely to fully leverage the advantages of GPR. If predicting the energy of relaxed structures is the objective, at least some relaxed structures should be included in the training dataset The algorithm presented here will not work for all molecular systems but I think everyone can appreciate the software integration :)  Future Extensions  Predicting structures — It would be nice to be able to predict low energy conformations. One way to do this is write an optimizer in ASE and use the GPR model as a surrogate for the energy calculation. Extrapolation to larger polymers — One potential way to extend the toy example I presented here is to predict the energy of a chain that is roughly the same size as the torsional correlation length. Beyond that length segments are uncorrelated and one might be able to extrapolate energy predictions to much larger polymers.  Known Issues  The validation and test sets are potentially contaminated, because I did not account for the symmetry present in the example system. Energies were not calculated on-the-fly in the active learning loop. I did this to keep things simple, but there is no reason it couldn’t be done in the future.

Creating planar or “locking” structures is of particular interest for tuning electronic properties. While noncovalent locks are an effective strategy for increasing planarity, the precise interactions leading to these planar structures are often unknown or mischaracterized. In this study, we demonstrate that aromaticity can be used to investigate, interpret, and modify the complex physical interactions which lead to planarity. Furthermore, we clearly illustrate the important role aromaticity has in determining the structure through torsional preferences and find that modern noncovalent locks utilize hyperconjugation to alter aromaticity and increase planarity. We envision that our approach and our explanation of prevalent noncovalent locks will assist in the design of improved materials for organic electronics.","tags":[],"title":"Aromaticity as a Guide to Planarity in Conjugated Molecules and Polymers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Changfei He","Peter R.

While increasing MW of linear segments yields a lower storage modulus at the rubbery plateau after softening above the glass transition (Tg), both Tg and the characteristic time of stress relaxation are independently governed by the conformational entropy of the embodied linear segments. Activation energies for bond exchange in the solid state are lower for networks incorporating flexible chains; the network topology freezing temperature decreases with increasing MW of flexible linear segments but increases with increasing MW of stiff segments. Vitrimer reconfigurability is therefore influenced not only by the energetics of bond exchange for a given network density, but also the entropy of polymer chains within the network.","tags":[],"title":"Conformational Entropy as a Means to Control the Behavior of Poly (diketoenamine) Vitrimers In and Out of Equilibrium","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kara D.

However, the atomistic phenomena governing ion diffusion and migration in polyelectrolytes are poorly understood, particularly in nonaqueous solvents. Here, the structural and transport properties of a model polyelectrolyte solution, poly(allyl glycidyl ether-lithium sulfonate) in dimethyl sulfoxide, are studied using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the static structural analysis of Li+ ion pairing is insufficient to fully explain the overall conductivity trend, necessitating a dynamic analysis of the diffusion mechanism, in which we observe a shift from largely vehicular transport to more structural diffusion as the Li+ concentration increases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that despite the significantly higher diffusion coefficient of the lithium ion, the negatively charged polyion is responsible for the majority of the solution conductivity at all concentrations, corresponding to Li+ transference numbers much lower than previously estimated experimentally. We quantify the ion–ion correlations unique to polyelectrolyte systems that are responsible for this surprising behavior. These results highlight the need to reconsider the approximations typically made for transport in polyelectrolyte solutions.","tags":[],"title":"Ion Transport and the True Transference Number in Nonaqueous Polyelectrolyte Solutions for Lithium-Ion Batteries","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"With the rise of modern high performance computers, it is possible to run quantum and classical simulations in automated high-throughput fashion.
