      <description>TL;DR: Running HPO at scale is important and Ray Tune makes that easy. When considering what HPO strategies to use for your project, start by choosing a scheduler — it can massively improve performance — with random search and build complexity as needed. When in doubt, ASHA is a good default scheduler.
Acknowledgements: I want to thank Zachary Ulissi (CMU), Mustafa Mustafa (NERSC), and Richard Liaw (Ray Tune) for making this work possible.</description>

      <description>Active Learning on Molecular Systems with GraphDot, xTB, ASE, and scikit-learn Original Post: 3/11/2020
Updated: 4/10/2020
Introduction Since the end of my PhD (Aug 2019), I have been interested in combining active learning with quantum calculations to explore configuration space in molecular systems. The goal of this post is to explore active learning on a simple system and to put a few ideas out there for people to think about and expand on.</description>
