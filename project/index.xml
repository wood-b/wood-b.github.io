      <description>With the rise of modern high performance computers, it is possible to run quantum and classical simulations in automated high-throughput fashion. I have contributed to a number of open source repositories that enable high-throughput chemistry and materials science. The software stack includes: pymatgen, custodian, and atomate. Check out our atomate publication.</description>

      <description>In macromolecules, there are numerous examples where structure dictates function including electronic conductivity of conjugated polymer materials. To elucidate the structure of doped and excited conjugated polymers we developed a multiscale model that captures electronic structure rearrangement and stochastically generates polymer chain conformations.
Two forthcoming publications will expand upon the impact of doping and excitation on conjugated polymer structure and the model/code (see above) used to generate chain conformations. Please check back early in the new year for updates.</description>

      <title>Elastic Tensor ML</title>

      <description>The Materials Project contains ~87,000 total materials with ~13,500 elastic tensors, which are computationally intensive to calculate from first principles. Although the total number computed will continue to grow, it would be nice to use the data we already have to predict elastic properties such as bulk and shear modulus for materials where the elastic tensor is yet to be calculated. As a result, the goals of this project are to compare machine learning (ML) models for predicting the bulk modulus, and to update the previous model that was trained on a smaller data set.</description>
