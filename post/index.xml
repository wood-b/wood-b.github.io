      <description>Introduction Since the end of my PhD, I have been interested in coupling active learning with quantum calculations to explore configuration space in molecular systems. The goal of this post is to demonstrate active learning on a simple system and to put a few ideas out there for people to think about and expand on. Another reason I wanted to make this post is that I think it is ridiculously cool how seamlessly GraphDot/xTB/ASE can work together.</description>
